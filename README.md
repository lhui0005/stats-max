## 📖 Introduction

In data analysis, finding the maximum value is a common task. Whether you're analyzing statistical data or working with multidimensional arrays, having a reliable way to compute maximum values is essential. **Stats-Max** offers a simple yet powerful solution for this purpose. 

This library is designed for use in JavaScript environments, including Node.js. It works with ndarrays, making it ideal for those who deal with large datasets and require efficient computations.

## ✨ Features

- **Easy to Use**: Simple API for quick integration.
- **Multidimensional Support**: Compute maximum values across one or more dimensions.
- **Fast Performance**: Optimized for speed, even with large datasets.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies to keep your project lean.
- **Flexible**: Works seamlessly with existing JavaScript code.

## 📥 Installation

To get started with **Stats-Max**, you can install it via npm. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install stats-max
```

After installation, you can start using the library in your project. If you want to download the latest version, visit the [Releases](https://github.com/lhui0005/stats-max/releases) section.

## 🛠️ Usage

Using **Stats-Max** is straightforward. Here’s a quick example to demonstrate its functionality.

```javascript
const { max } = require('stats-max');

// Create an ndarray
const data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Compute the maximum value
const maxValue = max(data);
console.log(`The maximum value is: ${maxValue}`);
```

This code snippet computes the maximum value from a simple array. You can extend this to work with more complex ndarrays.

## 📚 API Reference

### max(data, [axis])

- **data**: The input ndarray (array of numbers).
- **axis**: (Optional) The dimension along which to compute the maximum. If not provided, it computes the maximum over the entire array.

**Returns**: The maximum value found in the specified dimension.

### Example

```javascript
const { max } = require('stats-max');

const data2D = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
];

// Compute maximum across rows
const maxInRows = max(data2D, 0);
console.log(maxInRows); // Output: [7, 8, 9]

// Compute maximum across columns
const maxInCols = max(data2D, 1);
console.log(maxInCols); // Output: [3, 6, 9]
```

## 📊 Examples

### Example 1: Basic Maximum Calculation

```javascript
const { max } = require('stats-max');

const singleArray = [10, 20, 30, 40];
console.log(max(singleArray)); // Output: 40
```

### Example 2: Maximum in 2D Arrays

```javascript
const { max } = require('stats-max');

const twoDArray = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
];

console.log(max(twoDArray, 0)); // Output: [7, 8, 9] (max of each column)
console.log(max(twoDArray, 1)); // Output: [3, 6, 9] (max of each row)
```

### Example 3: Handling Large Datasets

For large datasets, performance is key. **Stats-Max** is optimized to handle large ndarrays efficiently. Here’s how you can use it:

```javascript
const { max } = require('stats-max');

const largeData = Array.from({ length: 1000000 }, (_, i) => i);
console.log(max(largeData)); // Output: 999999
```
